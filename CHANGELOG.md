# CHANGELOG: datawallet

Note that any version below 1.0.0 can have breaking changes.  

## [0.4.10] - 20240925
Make builds byte-for-byte reproducible.  

## [0.4.1] - 20240902
Decent beta version, ready for public use.  

## [0.1.0] - 20231016
Early release. Datawallet does its job, but it does *not* yet encrypt wallets in local storage.
