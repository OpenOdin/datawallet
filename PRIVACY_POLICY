OpenOdin Datawallet allows integration with OpenOdin-enabled applications.

The OpenOdin Datawallet uses browser local storage to maintain and hold the cryptographic key pairs the user has generated using OpenOdin Datawallet or imported from a previously generated, already existing, cryptographic key pair. These keys are symmetrically encrypted by a user-selected password. The user-provided password is temporarily cached for user's own convenience during a single browser session, but is never kept between browsing sessions.

The OpenOdin Datawallet does not collect or share data about its use, users, users' systems or users' devices.
The OpenOdin Datawallet does not collect URLs, browsing activity, search terms. The Datawallet does not intercept searches.
The OpenOdin Datawallet does not use the native messaging functionality. The Datawallet does not exchange messages with native applications installed on user's systems.

The OpenOdin Datawallet does not collect nor share any data on its own.
Whenever, and, if the user ever chooses to authenticate with a website using the Datawallet itself (explicitly reported by the Datawallet upon user's interaction with the extension when said functionality is available), then the Datawallet relays connections to that site over WebSocket, and it does so while protecting the user's cryptograhic keys from the third-party site.
With explicit user's consent, when the user is browsing a website which supports OpenOdin, the Datawallet can sign, send and fetch data nodes to and from the WebSocket endpoints defined by the website being visited by the user (third-party web application) to connect with the application's storage. In no way is that data or any metadata about that data shared anywhere else.

OpenOdin Datawallet does not communicate with third-party applications, software or websites automatically.
The OpenOdin Datawallet does NOT automatically reveal itself to visited websites.
However, if the user clicks on the Datawallet icon in the browser toolbar that will trigger the Datawallet to reveal and enable itself to the website opened in the current tab.

In case the user has explicitly allowed the Datawallet to run in private browsing sessions (private window), then any keys added and removed from the Datawallet will be reflected in non-private windows. However, no browsing history or search terms are recorded or shared.

OpenOdin-enabled applications may eventually monitor and log OpenOdin Datawallet information, namely user's Datawallet addresses, which are randomly generated identifiers and, in no way, expose personal information other than said pseudonymous identifiers (randomly generated addresses).
OpenOdin-enabled applications may also request user's permission to use the OpenOdin Datawallet local storage to maintain user's own preferences and settings on behalf of the application for improved user experience only. User settings are kept on a per-application basis. Applications settings are never shared between other applications.

If some future OpenOdin Datawallet feature requires communication or sharing of data with any third-party service different from what is described, it will be an optional, clearly stated, feature respecting user's consent (opt-in, disabled by default).

Any changes to this policy will result in the change of the "Last updated" date at the top of this document. A copy of the updated document will be openly available, including all its history and changes, as a file titled PRIVACY_POLICY in OpenOdin Datawallet source code repository on GitHub at https://github.com/OpenOdin/datawallet/.
